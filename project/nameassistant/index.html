<h1>Name Assistant</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Name Assistant makes it easy to bulk-add large numbers of computers to a configured
Mac OS X directory services directory, and name and number them appropriately.</p>
<p>Simply copy the application to a network account and set it to launch at login, then
login to each computer to be named as that user.</p>
<p>From here you can collect the MAC addresses of all computers and number them, before
adding them to the directory.</p>
<p>If you apply the "Name computer based on directory name" option in Workgroup Manager
upon reboot the computers will automatically begin using the name set using Name Assistant.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Client software only tested on 10.6 though I believe it works on 10.5 but cannot add
computers to groups.</li>
<li>Will work with any directory server that the client OS supports. OpenDirectory 10.4 - 10.7 should be fine and ActiveDirectory should work too if configured properly, though untested.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed setup and management</h2>
<p>Coming soon...</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding computers to ComputerGroup only works on 10.6 at the moment</li>
<li>Once a client has connected to a Name Assistant Master it will not reconnect to that
master or any other master until the program is relaunched</li>
<li>If a master crashes it might take 5 mins for it's Bonjour net service to dissapear off
the local area network. Clients might be unable to connect to a master until the record
has dissapeared</li>
<li>Next number is always 0 until the first number is allocated</li>
<li>The statusbar at the bottom of the master window isn't accurate</li>
<li>Resetting the clients using the master does not reset the "next number" display</li>
<li>Incorrect directory admin credentials results in a dsimport error code 65</li>
</ul>

<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change background color of window depending on status</li>
<li>When selecting a computer in the list view, make it's background color go blue</li>
</ul>
